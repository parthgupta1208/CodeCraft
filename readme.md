# CodeCraft

CodeCraft is an AGI, that can not only generate codes, but can also preview their output by executing the apps. It can also control your Web-Browser as and how you want it to. CodeCraft uses a GPT-3.5 agent and engineered prompts to generate highly error free codes and process mechanisms thus increasing efficiency.

## What can it do ?

- Code generation based on natural language inputs from the user
- Preview of generated code by executing it in the default environment
- Automate web-browser related tasks using prompt from the user
- Control basic system tasks such as starting an application or so

## Here's a demo of how it works
